# Unity 3 very basics ECS Hybrid, Pure and Job System examples
Unity 3D with very basics ECS Hybrid, Pure and Job Systems example

I have created 3 very basics example of hybrid, pure and job system examples.

3 systems run on same scene, with bear minimum, without manipulating any entities, or game objects.
I used TwoStick as reference, basically stripping it down.
I wanted to observe clearer, what is the major difference, between system types.

Bootstrap file is included.

No attachment to GameObject is required.
